# CppLexer

## Overview
C++ Construct Analyzer is a tool for recognizing and classifying simple C++ constructs using Python's PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) library. It identifies constructs such as variable declarations, if statements, function declarations, function definitions, and for loops, providing validation.

## Features
- **Tokenization**: Identifies C++ constructs using lexical analysis.
- **Parsing**: Validates the syntax of C++ constructs.
- **Classification**: Differentiates between various constructs like variable declarations, loops, and functions.

## Install the required PLY library using:
```bash
pip install ply
```
